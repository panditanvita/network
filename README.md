# network cultures bot

MirrorBot mines an incoming stream of tweets to find concepts (noun words) and cross-references them against adjective-noun phrases culled from an external corpus of printed English literature: everything from Project Gutenberg and then a little more besides (100 GB total).

The bot retweets and @'s the original tweeter. Please comment if you would prefer this bot does not contact you.

It uses the [DescribingWords](https://describingwords.io) API for cross-referencing and the Tweepy API for contacting Twitter.

The bot was created as part of the MIT CMS.614 Network Cultures class assignments.
